# Adaptive Traffic Manager

## Overview

The **Adaptive Traffic Manager** is a real-time traffic control system that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to assess traffic density at a crossroad. Based on vehicle counts, the system dynamically adjusts traffic light durations to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv5.
- Dynamic traffic light control based on traffic density.
- Adjustable green light durations based on detected vehicle count.
- Easy integration with traffic light control hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi with GPIO).
